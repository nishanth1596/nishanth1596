## üë®‚Äçüíª Hi, I‚Äôm Nishanth Venkatesan ‚Äì Frontend Developer ![Open to Work](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20to-Frontend%20Developer%20roles-brightgreen?style=flat-square)



üöÄ  3.1+ years of React experience | Building clean, scalable frontend apps with React, TypeScript, Tailwind & Redux.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a frontend developer with a strong focus on React, TypeScript, and building user-first interfaces. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with code and constantly improving through hands-on projects, challenges, and collaboration.

Lately, I've started diving into backend development to understand what truly happens beyond the UI, learning Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to build complete full-stack applications.

## Open Source Contribution
- **React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS Setup Script**
- **Role: Co-Creator**
- **Date: 02-02-2025**

I co-created an automation script with Bhuvnesh Upadhyay to set up React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS projects with a single command. This script streamlines the process of setting up a new project, installing Tailwind CSS, and ensuring an optimized environment for developers.

**üöÄ Key Features:**

Automatically sets up a Vite project with React and TypeScript.
Installs and configures Tailwind CSS.
Removes unnecessary files to keep the project clean.
Pre-configures App.tsx with a Tailwind-styled component.
üéâ This tool is now helping other developers bootstrap projects faster and follow a clean, consistent setup process. I actively maintain and improve it to keep up with the latest in frontend tooling.
